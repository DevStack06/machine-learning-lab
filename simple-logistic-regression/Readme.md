   2. Develop a binomial  logistic regression using single attribute “age”
Observe all parameters (Null Deviance, Residual deviance, P value, Fisher score, AIC , Degree of freedom)

   3. Develop a binomial  logistic regression using two  attribute “age + salary”
Observe changes in all parameters (Null Deviance, Residual deviance, P value, Fisher score, AIC , Degree of freedom)


Task2-
 Loan repay prediction using detailed bank loan data.
    1. Download bank dataset-

   2. Develop a final (as per your criteria and knowledge) binomial  logistic regression model.
Hint- You may use wither forward or backward selection process to get acceptable number of features. Meanwhile, see AIC/deviance/pvalue to check the significance of features.
