This are the task performed in the kmeans.ipynb programme file
    
    1.use the g.csv file as a dataset
    2. Upload the data into environment
    3. Observe the data 
    4. We’ll need to drop the Channel and Region variables.  
    These are two ID fields and are not useful in clustering. So drop it.
    5. Set some seed value
    6. Apply the k-mean on dataset, with k=5
    7. Observe the #number samples in each cluster
    8. Observe the center of cluster against each features,
    9. Interpret the cluster results
    10. Measure homogeneity of each cluster (SSE)
    11. Measure total SSE
    12. Measure the heterogeneity of cluster 
    13. Elbow measure: run the algorithm 100 time for k=2 to 20. 
    14. Draw the plot and observe elbow point.
